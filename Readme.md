## Tiny Lang Parser Ada

This is another frontend for Tiny Lang, this time written in Ada. This was a long-pending project of mine to do some compiler work with Ada, and once again Tiny Lang gave me a good base to do the experiments. I'm fairly new to Ada, so this isn't the most elegant program ever, but it seems to run well.

Like the Rust version (if you've seen it...), this is just a limited frontend. The entire language itself is parsed, but there is only limited syntax checking and no semantic or type checking. Nevertheless, it's ready to go for the rest of a compiler.
